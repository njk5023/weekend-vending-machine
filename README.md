# weekend-vending-machine
Java capstone weekend project for Tech Elevator. Simulates a vending machine using File I/O and command line interface.

TO-DO:
- Strengthen regex used to generate Sales Report txt file, or decouple it from the transaction log entirely
- Consider changing HashMap to LinkedHashMap for linear ordering instead of alphabetizing keys with a method
- Enhance CLI view with more information on each "screen"
